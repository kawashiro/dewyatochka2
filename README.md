### The most stupid bakabot ever

Dewyatochka is not a gay neither a trap!
----------------------------------------
Dewyatochka is an ice fairy. While she is described as a weak boss in the Touhou series,
if we consider the power of average fairies - who appear often as regular enemies - we can certainly say
she is exceptionally strong for her kind **and not a gay**.
Her personality is childish, as you might expect from her appearance.

Dependencies
------------
* [Python 3.3](https://www.python.org/ "Python") or higher
* [SleekXMPP 1.2](https://github.com/fritzy/SleekXMPP "SleekXMPP") or higher
* [PyQuery 1.2](https://github.com/gawel/pyquery "PyQuery") or higher (recommended)
* [pyasn1_modules](http://pypi.python.org/pypi/pyasn1-modules) (recommended)
* [lxml 3.4](http://lxml.de/) or higher (recommended)

Installing
----------
It's not a good practise to do so in your distro but this is the only way for now (be sure to install all dependencies required to run)

    # git clone https://github.com/kawashiro/dewyatochka2
    # cd ./dewyatochka2/
    # python3 ./setup.py install -O2
